Assignment:

We haven’t done anything with a circularstructure. Amazingly, if we implement the linked queue with a circle, we can doaway with the front reference and have only a rear reference. (We cannot keep front and eliminate rear,or at least it is inefficient to do so.)

This implementation has no dummy nodes, sodon’t forget that you may need to change what rearitself is pointing to. Also, the empty queue (starting from empty or becomingempty) may be a special case.

Part 1: Write the Java code or pseudocode forenqueue() for the singly-linked circular queueimplementation with a rear, NO front,and no dummy node.

Part 2: Write the Java code or pseudocode fordequeue() for the singly-linked circular queueimplementation with a rear, NO front,and no dummy node. Use the version of dequeue() that deletes the node from thequeue and returns the value that was in it.
